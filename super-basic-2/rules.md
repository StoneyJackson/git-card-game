# Super Basic 2

The goal of this variant is to illustrate the relationship between push and pull operations and their impact on a shared project.


## What's new

- Issues replaced by tasks
- General rewrite of rules


## Goal

Cooperatively complete all issues in the fewest number of rounds.


## Cards

To play this variant, you need only the following cards.

- Push (Action)
- Pull (Action)
- Change (Action)
- Error (Risk)
- No Error (Risk)
- Task (Task)


## Setup

- Action pile and discard pile
- Task pile and discard pile
- Risk pile and discard pile


## Play

- Starting your turn
  - Draw action cards into your hand until you have 5 cards.
  - If you have nothing to work on, assign yourself some tasks.
- During your turn you can do any of the following
  - Once per turn, you can play a change card OR split a work pile
  - Play any number of non-change action cards
  - Do nothing
- Ending your turn
  - Discard any number of cards from your hand


## Assigning yourself tasks

- Role a 6-sided die, draw that many task cards and place them face up in a single pile in front of you. This becomes a work pile.


## Working

- To get work done, play a change card on a work pile.



## Pushing your work pile

- Before you can push your work pile your work pile must
  - Have equal number of change and task cards
  - Be free of stale tokens and risk cards
- To push your pile
  - Play a push card
  - Mark all other work piles with a stale token if they aren't already marked with a stale token.
  - Deal risk cards face down onto each other work pile equal to the minimum of the number of change in that pile and the number of changes in the pile you are pushing.


## Splitting a work pile

- Before you can split a work pile
  - The pile must belong to you
  - The pile must contain at least 2 task cards
  - The pile must not contain any changes
- To split a work pile
  - Divide your work pile into two piles; the two piles do not have to be equal in size
  - If the original pile was marked with a stale token, mark the new piles with a stale token.


## Removing stale tokens

- To remove all stale tokens on your work piles
  - Play one pull card
  - Remove stale tokens
  - Turn over risk cards on each of your work piles


## Resolving risk

- Before you can resolve a risk card
  - The cards must be face up (see Removing stale tokens)
- To resolve a risk card
  - If the card is a "No Error" card, discard it.
  - If the card is an "Error" card, play a change card by discarding both the change card and the Error card.
    - Remember you can only play one change per turn. This includes change cards played to resolve errors.
