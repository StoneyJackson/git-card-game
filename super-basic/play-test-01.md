# Play Test

- Variant: Super Basic
- Players: 2
  - One who knows git
  - One who is married to a person who knows git
- Games: 2
  - Once with hand size 5
  - Once with hand size 3 and the ability to choose issues

## Strengths

Very few cards makes it easier to explain, learn, and understand.

## Improvements

Players need to be able to make decisions that can effect the outcome of the game. In this variant the only choice a player can make is if and which cards to discard to hopefully draw the cards they need. But there is little a player can do to avoid risk. So the one complication in the game (risk) is relatively unavoidable.

Another thought was make each issue have a size of 1. Then roll a die to determine how many issues to draw. This is then a single issue of that size. But, on your turn, instead of playing a change card, you could split the issue into smaller issues. Then you could work on smaller changes and commit more incrementally. This models the idea of taking time to decompose a problem into smaller problems, and then work on each sub issue. There are some issues to work out here, but it's and interesting idea.

## Insights

The size of a hand should be a function of the number of different types of action cards in the game. The more types, the bigger the hand needs to be. In this variant, there are only 3 types of cards. The first time we played this variant with 5 cards and we always had cards that we needed; there was no scarcity. The second time we played with 3 cards this was a bit more interesting.

There was a bit more interest when we started discussing "what ifs". E.g., how might we control risk? What if we could push partial work? What if we could split issues into smaller issues.

We used 3x5" index cards to create new cards. This worked pretty well. They are a little large. But plenty of room to write on the cards (notes etc).
